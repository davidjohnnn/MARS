# MARS: Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes for Car Damage Instance Segmentation

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Welcome to the official repository for **MARS**â€”a cutting-edge deep learning model designed for car damage instance segmentation. MARS leverages advanced self-attention mechanisms within sequential quadtree nodes to produce highly accurate segmentation masks, offering a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods like Mask R-CNN, PointRend, and Mask Transfiner.

## Project Overview

Accurately assessing car damage is crucial for the insurance industry, yet traditional deep learning models struggle with fine segmentation and image complexity. MARS (Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes) introduces a novel approach, recalibrating channel weights using a quadtree transformer to enhance segmentation precision. Our model has been rigorously tested and has achieved notable performance gains:

- **+1.3 maskAP** improvement using the R50-FPN backbone
- **+2.3 maskAP** improvement with the R101-FPN backbone on the Thai car-damage dataset

MARS was presented at the **International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing 2023 (ICIAP 2023)** in Udine, Italy.
